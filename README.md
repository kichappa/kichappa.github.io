# Hello World
This is the repository for my personal website. You may visit it [here](https://kichappa.github.io/).

## About Me
Howdy, visitor. Let me tell you a bit about myself.

I love math, coding, and design. I am a civil engineer by training and an alumnus of IIT Madras. I believe there are two types of hobbies: beyond and anterior to the fourth wall. In the former, I love watching detective TV shows and The Office. My favourite TV show is Psych. I spend my free time thinking of coding silly and creative design problems as part of the latter.

I primarily code using Python. I have a love-hate relationship with the scipy library. ReactJS is my go-to library for web development; I hate jQuery. Although I don't have much experience, I thoroughly enjoy WebGL and Shaders programming. I have worked on three creative coding projects as of now. I am currently ideating on a fourth one.

I am currently applying for graduate school in computational science and engineering programs in the Fall '23 admission cycle. Hopefully, I will get into my dream school. Let me leave you with some afterthoughts as you finish this very discontinuous brief about myself.

How do shapes affect the function of buildings? What are our limits as engineers? Can Python play GeoGuessr? I like to explore such questions, questions that deal with computation and design. My skills in engineering and my creative outlook help me work on bridging design and engineering.

## Projects
I work on projects that have some applied math in it, and you can find my projects [here](https://kichappa.github.io/#/projects).
