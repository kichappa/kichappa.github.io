# Hello World
This is the repository for my personal website. You may visit it [here](https://kichappa.github.io/).

## About Me
Howdy, visitor. Let me tell you a bit about myself.

I love math, coding, design and art. I am a CSE doctoral student at Georgia Tech, previously a civil engineer, and an alumnus of IIT Madras. I believe there are two types of hobbies: beyond and into the fourth wall. In the former, I love watching detective TV shows and The Office. My favourite TV show is Psych (please watch it). I spend my free time thinking of coding silly and creative design problems as part of the latter.

I primarily code using Python (hey kishore, learn Julia when?). I'm learning Julia now, happy? I have a love-hate relationship with the scipy library. ReactJS is my go-to library for web development; I hate jQuery, we are not friends if you don't. And, let's not forget my thorough joy with WebGL and shaders. I have worked on three creative coding projects to date and am currently ideating on a fourth one .

My research focuses on a combination of biomimicry, manufacturing and computation, and is advised by Dr. Emily Sanders. I am excited! Let me leave you with some afterthoughts as you finish this very discontinuous brief about myself.

How do shapes affect the function of buildings? What are our limits as engineers? Can Python play GeoGuessr? I like to explore such questions, questions that deal with computation and design. My skills in engineering and my creative outlook help me work on bridging design and engineering.

## Projects
I work on projects that have some applied math in it, and you can find my projects [here](https://kichappa.github.io/#/projects).
